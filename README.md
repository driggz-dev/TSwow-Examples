Description of Repository Files

Heirlooms.ts : An heirloom datascript that can be placed in your modules/yourmodule/datascripts and built. Adds in most of the heirlooms missing that were added in later
expansions such as: cloaks, helmets, pants, and the might heirlooms. 

Mounts.ts : An example of how to create mounts quickly using TSwow. Cannot "plug and play" unless you have my DBCs.

necromancter.ts & necromancertalents.ts : The best example I can provide of in-depth class creation. Very unique spells found within, including Bone Spikes from D3 created in WoW.
